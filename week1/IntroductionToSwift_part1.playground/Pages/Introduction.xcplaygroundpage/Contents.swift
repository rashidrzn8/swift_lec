 # Playground: Week1 - Introduction to Swift language part 1


 ## Overview
 This playground provides a brief over view of Swift language.
 Code fragments explain the language constructs and you should run the code to get
 a better undestanding of the topic.

 Playground execution should be set to manual so that you can choose up to what point the code lines are executed from the start.
 The LHS panel is the projext explorer where you can see the playground files and resources. The centre panel is the code editor, where you can type code. The RHS panel provides information on the values of the variables with eye option showing this under the line of code.

 There are questions that requires to write some code to test your understanding - do attempt this and ask your tutor for help if things are unclear.

 Playground is organised as a collection of pages that can be accessed using the links in the TOC.
